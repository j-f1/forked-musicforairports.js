# Music for Airports

A JavaScript edition of [Ambient 1: Music for Airports 2/1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_1:_Music_for_Airports)
by Brian Eno, as built in the [JavaScript Systems Music](http://teropa.info/blog/2016/07/28/javascript-systems-music.html) guide.

See live demos [here](http://teropa.info/blog/2016/07/28/javascript-systems-music.html#putting-it-together-launching-the-loops) and [here](http://teropa.info/blog/2016/07/28/javascript-systems-music.html#exploring-variations-on-music-for-airports).

Uses instrument samples from the [Sonatina Symphonic Orchestra](http://sso.mattiaswestlund.net/download.html). You can get more of them by downloading the ZIP from their site.

Also uses an impulse response sample from [AirWindows](http://www.airwindows.com/airwindows-impulses/).

This project setup differs from the one in the article in the following:

1. The canvas visualization is included as well, not just the music.
2. Sample buffers are cached in memory instead of fetching them anew each time.
3. Babel is used for ES2015 to ES5 compilation instead of running ES2015 natively in the browser.

## Development

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`

This installs a live local server as well as a Babel compiler watcher. Changes in `src` are picked up automatically.

## Build and Deployment

To build the project, just invoke `npm run build`. Everything you need will be in the `dist` folder:

- `index.html` to host the application
- `musicforairport.js`, the compiled source code of the app.
- `musicforairports.min.js`, a minified version of the source code.
- `Samples` samples used to play the music and to generate the convolution reverb.

### Embedding

If you want to embed the player on an existing website, take a look at `index.html`. There are three key parts you need to take from there and add to your page:

- A `<canvas>` element with id `music-for-airports`.
- The whatwg-fetch polyfill and the Web Audio API shim libraries for cross-browser compatibility.
- The `musicforairports.js` or `musicforairports.min.js` script tag.
